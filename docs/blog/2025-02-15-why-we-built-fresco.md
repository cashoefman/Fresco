When starting new SwiftUI projects, we noticed that many teams repeatedly encountered similar challenges—consistency, maintainability, and speed of development. We created the Fresco Design System to directly address these pain points.

Fresco provides:

- **Consistency:** Unified and intuitive UI components.
- **Maintainability:** Clearly defined guidelines and structured components.
- **Speed:** Accelerate your app development without sacrificing quality.

We’re excited to see how Fresco simplifies your development workflow.
